    <h1>What's GoMap?</h1>
    <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Quick Overview</h5>
    <p class = "w3-text-grey">GoMap is the Capstone project BitCrunch has worked on from the Fall ‘22 to Spring ’23 semesters. Our main goal is to help IT technicians in the field to detect and diagnose the causes of various issues with their assigned devices, without the use of messy and long console commands. At the click of a button, users are able to run a specific script to a chosen device, just like how they would through the console. This greatly lowers the skill floor for IT technicians, and allows easier repair (or non-repair) of their machines.
</p>
    <h5 class = "w3-padding-32">Long Overview</h5>
    <p class = "w3-text-grey">      GoMap is designed to be run on an intranet, local to the area of which a group of IT technicians perform their duties. As for this demonstration, with the application being uploaded to the internet, we have removed the ability to run any scripts outside of the basic “ping”, to be sure that nothing nefarious happens on behalf of our users. <br><br>I also made a website for this website, so that users of GoMap could get a better feel of what GoMap is used for. A link to that can be found here: <a href= "https://sccapstone.github.io/BitCrunch/">https://sccapstone.github.io/BitCrunch/</a> and, most importantly, includes a video of the team using it. Everything on the GitHub page : <a href = "https://github.com/SCCapstone/BitCrunch">https://github.com/SCCapstone/BitCrunch</a>, has not been touched since the due date of the project, including the wiki, so things may be a bit messy. However, as the leader of the team, I'm happy to answer any questions you may have about it!</p>

        <p class="w3-text-grey">GoWeb, built using Golang, is designed to be an IT help website, hosted on a local webserver (or on an Intranet rather than an Internet), which allows IT technicians to effortlessly run specific commands to any statically domained IP object, such as printers or Wireless Access Points(WAP). The idea for this came about from my summer at CCSD (seen above), where some technicians struggled with or never used console commands to check problematic devices. GoWeb makes it so that technicians can run scripts to a device at a click of a button!</p>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">Our Capstone project at the University of South Carolina is structured in such a way that the students build the project from the ground up, going from an idea into a full fledged product.

        <p class="w3-text-grey">From a technical standpoint, the webapp, using a combination of Golang, HTML, CSS, and Javascript, holds information about users, floors, and devices using SQL. Running commands are done using Go's os library, through a custom function written by me. Unit testing is done using Golang's testing library, while Behavorial testing is done using go-rod, which you can read more about here: <a href='https://go-rod.github.io/#/'>https://go-rod.github.io/#/</a>. </p>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">In my group, I filled the role of "Ideas and Implementation", alongside "Testing". I was the person coming up with the ideas, helping people move those ideas into physical form, and making sure the implementation was sound. I like to think of myself as the leader of the group, especially during the first few steps of getting our idea off the ground. If someone needed help, I was there. If someone had an idea, I made sure everyone else acknowledged them and understood all aspects of that idea. In addition, I also completed Unit and Behavorial Testing on my own, both of which test the application to completion(Test-Based Development). I also wrote the custom function to run scripts, which has an option for comments in addition to to normal commands.</p>

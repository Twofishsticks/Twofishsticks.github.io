# Trey Sturman - Portfolio 

This program is designed to create a server and webpage for my collections of created programs. 

Created in Go, using gin framework, with the help of some classic html. 

If you would like to re-build, use go build -o "application name". app.exe has been provided for ease of access

To run, execute the built go file on your machine, and navigate to localhost 8080 in your browser.

    <h5 class="w3-padding-32">University of South Carolina 2020-2023<br> BS in Computer Science, Minor in Mathematics</h5>
    <p class="w3-text-grey">I graduated UofSC in just 3 years (2020-2023), with a full diploma and a minor. With COVID taking up my first year, I can say that I’ve graduated in just 2 years. I did dip into a few clubs during my time there, some rocketry, esports, IEE, but I never devoted myself to just one club. I’m fairly sure my final GPA was around 3.4-3.5, but I’d let my transcript say that for sure.  </p>
    <p class="w3-text-grey">I headed a few projects during my time here, and you can see some of them either on my GitHub <a href= https://github.com/Twofishsticks> https://github.com/Twofishsticks</a>, or on my page <a href=stuff.html> which can be found here</a>. </p>

    <h1>Work Experience</h1>
    <h5 class="w3-padding-32">IT Intern at Charleston County School District (May 2022 - Aug 2022)</h5>
    </div>
    <!--put this into multi paragraphs-->
    <p class="w3-text-grey">Interning at CCSD was my first internship and tech-related job I've had. It was a crazy experience, through and through.
        </p> <p class="w3-text-grey">
        First off, interns at CCSD were in an odd limbo state when I was there. There are technically two types of “interns” there: one who is hired as an extra hand, doing special projects the district can’t do while school is in session, and one who bounces around all parts of IT, from server-side networking to phone lines to in-the-field technicians. I fell into the second category. Full time employees said that I was the second intern they’ve had doing this, so the internship as a whole wasn’t fully fleshed out yet. I had to take the initiative to learn from the professionals. 
        </p> <p class="w3-text-grey">
        While I was there, I absorbed so much knowledge I wouldn’t normally have been exposed to. As a Computer Science graduate, I'm not exposed to much of the networking/physical aspects of technology. It was part of the reason why I took this position in the first place: to get a new look on what I’m learning about. The following is a list of the highlights from my time there. 
        </p><p class="w3-text-grey">
        <h5>Re-routing a school under one network into two.</h5>
        <br>Two schools physically connected were under one subnetwork. This project split them into two separate subnetworks, changing all IPs in one school without a loop during the transition. 
        
</p><p class="w3-text-grey">
        <h5>Moved Telecom phones to Cisco phones.</h5>
        <br> Also had a quick overview of the physical PA lines, which are still in use!
        </p><p class="w3-text-grey">
        <h5>Learned about Routers, Switches, and Powerbanks!</h5>
        <br>In addition to their basic usage, also went through how to console into them, make basic changes. Big fan of EATONs. Also a big reason behind my Capstone Project!
        </p><p class="w3-text-grey">
        <h5>Other basic IT.</h5>
        <br> Fixing printers, re-wiring ethernet cords, organizing TR closets, imaging computers, Radix for promethean boards, and a Ticketing system with priorities (not specifically Jira but VERY similar).
        </p><p class="w3-text-grey">
            <br>Overall, it was extraordinary being able to shift what I’m doing in classes to the side, draw on it here and there, and learn how to put said knowledge into real-world applications. Please shoot me an email if you'd like even more detail on my position there!</p>

        <h1>Major Projects</h1>
        <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Capstone Project - GoWeb</h5>
        <p class = "w3-text-black">We are currently finished with the project! I made the website explaining what our project is, you can find that here: <a href = 'https://sccapstone.github.io/BitCrunch/'>https://sccapstone.github.io/BitCrunch/</a>, and our GitHub repo here <a href=’https://github.com/SCCapstone/BitCrunch'> https://github.com/SCCapstone/BitCrunch</a>. </p>

        <p class="w3-text-grey">GoWeb, built using Golang, is designed to be an IT help website, hosted on a local webserver (or on an Intranet rather than an Internet), which allows IT technicians to effortlessly run specific commands to any statically domained IP object, such as printers or Wireless Access Points(WAP). The idea for this came about from my summer at CCSD (seen above), where some technicians struggled with or never used console commands to check problematic devices. GoWeb makes it so that technicians can run scripts to a device at a click of a button!</p>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">Our Capstone project at the University of South Carolina is structured in such a way that the students build the project from the ground up, going from an idea into a full fledged product. For more information, feel free to check out the webpage for the class here: <a href='https://capstone.cse.sc.edu/'>https://capstone.cse.sc.edu/</a>. </p>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">From a technical standpoint, the webapp, using a combination of Golang, HTML, CSS, and Javascript, holds information about users, floors, and devices using SQL. Running commands are done using Go's os library, through a custom function written by me. Unit testing is done using Golang's testing library, while Behavorial testing is done using go-rod, which you can read more about here: <a href='https://go-rod.github.io/#/'>https://go-rod.github.io/#/</a>. </p>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">In my group, I filled the role of "Ideas and Implementation", alongside "Testing". I was the person coming up with the ideas, helping people move those ideas into physical form, and making sure the implementation was sound. I like to think of myself as the leader of the group, especially during the first few steps of getting our idea off the ground. If someone needed help, I was there. If someone had an idea, I made sure everyone else acknowledged them and understood all aspects of that idea. In addition, I also completed Unit and Behavorial Testing on my own, both of which test the application to completion(Test-Based Development). I also wrote the custom function to run scripts, which has an option for comments in addition to to normal commands.</p>
